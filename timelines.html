				The Bosnian Peace Process is used because the Dayton agreement of 1995 is a close fit to the constitution and therefore provides a good benchmark for the methodology.
				The Bosnia & Herzegovina constitution was enacted in 1995 and updated in 2010. We are using the updated version.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are 164 encoded sections extracted from the constitution, 158 of which are mapped by the provisions of preceding peace agreements. A list of these sections
				can be viewed <a href="./sections.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

					The plot below shows a classic timeline from the earliest agreement to the updated constitution at the right. 
					The constitution is marked as a green line, the height of which is equal to the 158 mapped sections. Preceding agreements containing provisions that map onto
					sections are shown in blue. Non-mapping agreements are shown in red. The highest blue line is the Dayton agreement.
					</p>
					<p>
						A constitution is always shown as a line at the final day of the year it was enacted or updated. This is because day and month data are not available.
					</p>
					<p>
					The height of an agreement's line represents the size of the set of sections mapped by the agreement's provisions. 
					It's possible that a section is mapped by more than one provision and using set size removes double-counting.
					See <a href="./clusters.html" target="_blank">Clusters and Summarisation</a> for an analysis of provision-section clusters.

				The plot below shows a heatmap representation of a matrix of Boolean values. Each row in the matrix represents one of the 158 mapped sections of the constitution.
				Sections are ordered by when they are first mapped by one or more agreement provisions. The plot shows the flow of mapped sections across the time series of agreements.
				Each column represents a mapping agreement. Agreements are in date order. Cell values are:
				<ul>
					<li>0 coded as black. The section in the row is not mapped by any provisions of the agreement in the column. </li>
					<li>1 coded as yellow. The section in the row is mapped by at least one provision of the agreement in the column. </li>
				</ul>
				The Dayton agreement is the yellow bar at index 42.

					The plot below shows the matrix as a set of horizontal lines, one per section. A dot means that the section is mapped by at least one provision of the agreement
					at the dot's position on the x-axis. The plot shows the flow of mapped sections across the time series of agreements.
