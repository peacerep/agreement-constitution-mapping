				The Bosnian Peace Process is used because the Dayton agreement of 1995 is a close fit to the constitution and therefore provides a good benchmark for the methodology.
				The Bosnia & Herzegovina constitution was enacted in 1995 and updated in 2010. We are using the updated version.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are 164 encoded sections extracted from the constitution, 158 of which are mapped by the provisions of preceding peace agreements.

					The plot below shows a classic timeline from the earliest agreement to the updated constitution at the right. 
					The constitution is marked as a green line, the height of which is equal to the 158 mapped sections. Preceding agreements containing provisions that map onto
					sections are shown in blue. Non-mapping agreements are shown in red. The highest blue line is the Dayton agreement.
					</p>
					<p>
						A constitution is always shown as a line at the final day of the year it was enacted or updated. This is because day and month data are not available.
					</p>
					<p>
					The height of an agreement's line represents the size of the set of sections mapped by the agreement's provisions. 
					It's possible that a section is mapped by more than one provision and using set size removes double-counting. However, the analysis of networks of sections and provisions
					is ongoing as a clustering/summarisatiom exercise.

				The plot below shows a heatmap representation of a matrix of Boolean values. Each row in the matrix represents one of the 158 mapped sections of the constitution.
				Each column represents a mapping agreement. Cell values are:
				<ul>
					<li>0 coded as black. The section in the row is not mapped by any provisions of the agreement in the column) </li>
					<li>1 coded as yellow. The section in the row is mapped by at least one provision of the agreement in the column) </li>
				</ul>
				The Dayton agreement is the yellow bar at index 42.

					The plot below shows the matrix as a set of horizontal lines, one per section. A dot means that the section is mapped by at least one provision of the agreement
					at the dot's position on the x-axis.
