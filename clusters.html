			<h2>Clustering, summarisation, and diffusion</h2>

				Using agreements preceding the Sudan constitution of 2019.

			<h3>Network Diagram</h3>
		</div>
		<div>
			<div>
					<p>
					The plot below shows a network built from provision-section pairs. Provisions are in pink and are labelled with the agreement ID and provision number.
					Sections are in blue and are labelled with the section number only.
					</p>
					<p>
						The network comprises a set of disjoint subgraphs or clusters. Altogether there are 65 clusters. 
						Because some provisions map onto more than one section, and sections may be mapped by more than one provision, larger clusters may form as the provision-section pairs join together.
						There are 20 of these larger clusters, the remaining 45 clusters are simple provision-section pairs.
					</p>
					<p>
						A degree centrality algorithm is applied to all 65 clusters in order to provide summarisation of the content of clusters.
						A summary comprises the most salient provision and section of a cluster measured in terms of the number of connections to sections and provisions respectively.
						Clusters containing a single provision-section pair are limiting cases.

			<h3>Diffusion</h3>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				Diffusion tracks summarisation topics across a time series of agreements. The diagrams below are representations of a Boolean valued topic-agreement matrix
				for a time series of agreements preceding the Sudan constitution of 2019.
				Summarisation topics are arranged in order of first appearance in the agreement sequence. The matrix provides information about:
				<ul>
					<li>Which summarisation topics are mentioned most (row marginals).</li>
					<li>Which agreements mention the most summarisation topics (column marginals).</li>
					<li>When a summarisation topic first appears in the agreement sequence.</li>
					<li>Clustering of summarisation topics.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Agreements are in date order. In the first diagram the cell values are:
				<ul>
					<li>0 coded as black. The agreement in the column does not contain the summarisation topic in the row. </li>
					<li>1 coded as yellow. The agreement in the column does contain the summarisation topic in the row. </li>
				</ul>
				In the second diagram a dot represents a agreement containing a summarisation topic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Agreement 350 is the first in the series and is the <em>Darfur Peace Agreement</em> of 05/05/2006. The number of summarisation
				topics may be explained in part by the influence of the preceding Sudan constitution of 2005. The influence of a previous constitution can 
				be accounted for when determining the influence of an agreement on a future constitution.

			<h3>Listing</h3>

		<div>
			<div>
				<p>
					Below are the 65 summarisation topics. 
					Summarisation topics are listed in order of first appearance in the agreement time series. Note that the provision component of a summarisation topic
					is not necessarily taken from the agreement in which the topic first appears.
