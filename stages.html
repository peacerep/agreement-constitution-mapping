			<h3>Is there a relationship between the stage of an agreement and the likelihood that the agreement contains provisions that map onto sections of a future constitution? </h3>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				There are 1447 agreements in the mapping analysis. Of these 1447 agreements, 985 precede an in-force constitution.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of the 985 agreements that precede an in-force constitution, 418 contain provisions that map onto sections of the constitution. These 418 agreements are referred to as mapping agreements. 
				The remaining 567 agreements are the non-mapping agreements.
			</p>

				Plot 1 below shows the distribution over stages of the 567 non-mapping agreements.
