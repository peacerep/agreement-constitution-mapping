Serbia and Montenegro and the so-called Yugoslav People's Army, instigated, engaged in or supported an armed rebellion, the aim of which was the secession of Croatian territories in favour of Serbia and Montenegro, Whereas during the armed rebellion and aggression against Croatia many criminal acts, grave breaches of international humanitarian law and of the basic rights of the individual were committed, Whereas during the war emotional and inappropriate language was used in the private and public arena so as to generalize guilt and strengthen feelings of hate and division, Taking into consideration the will of the people of the former Socialist Republic of Croatia expressed in a referendum on 19 May 1991, regarding the future of their Republic in the circumstances of the disintegration of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Proceeding from the Constitutional Decision on the Sovereignty and Independence of the Republic of Croatia, passed by the Croatian Parliament (Sabor) on 25 June 1991 in response to the will of the people expressed through the referendum, and the Decision of the Croatian Parliament (Sabor), passed on 8 October 1991, in which the Republic of Croatia severed all constitutional and legal ties with the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and proclaimed its independence, Also taking into consideration that the largest part of the occupied territories that were under the control of the rebel and other aggressor forces have been liberated, that is, that the greater part of the territories identified by the United Nations General Assembly in its resolution 49/43 of 9 December 1994 have been successfully reintegrated into the constitutional and legal system of the Republic of Croatia, and that, with the completion of the mandate of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) pursuant to the Basic Agreement on the Croatian Danube Region, the last part of Croatian state territory will also be successfully and permanently reintegrated into the constitutional and legal system of the Republic of Croatia, Whereas the Government of the Republic of Croatia strives to promote a way of life in which forgiveness, tolerance, coexistence and equal rights of all its citizens are a foundation for progress and development, Reiterating that many citizens who took part in the armed rebellion against the Republic of Croatia have sought and been granted Croatian documents, and that they have by this act accepted all the rights and obligations that derive from Croatian citizenship, including respect for and defence of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Croatia, and that they have accepted the Republic of Croatia as their homeland and have expressed the wish to be included in its political, economic and social life, and in that way to contribute to its prosperity, Whereas the restoration of trust between all its citizens is of vital interest for the development of the Republic of Croatia as a State and as a respected member of the international community of States, Whereas it is unconstitutional to distinguish between the former parties in conflict on the basis of ethnicity, as such a distinction results in collective guilt and ignores individual responsibility for crimes, and also ignores the positive role of members of various ethnic groups during the hostilities, Given that by the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and the Croatian Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and on the Rights of Ethnic or National Communities and Minorities, as well as Croatia's succession to or ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Paris Charter for a New Europe and other relevant documents of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) with regard to human rights, the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Basic Freedoms and its Related Protocol, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the legal foundations for the implementation of the highest international standards in the field of human rights have been established, Whereas the Republic of Croatia has adopted and is
