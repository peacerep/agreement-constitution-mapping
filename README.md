# agreement-constitution-mapping
Maps semantic relationship between agreement provisions and sections of a future constitution.

The processing pipeline has been updated to use CCP constitutions in XML format.

This repo is a [static site demonstrator](https://peacerep.github.io/agreement-constitution-mapping/index.html) with the following UX:
1. Select a country from the list of countries in order to view the list of peace agreements containing provisions that map onto at least one constitution section.
2. Select an agreement to view the list of provisions that map onto at least one constitution section.
3. Select a provision to view the list of semantically similary constitution sections.
4. Click on a section to deep link to the section on [https://www.constituteproject.org](https://www.constituteproject.org)

The following analysis demonstrations have been added:
1. The relationship between agreement stage and the likelihood that an agreement contains provisions that map onto constitution sections. 
2. Which peace processes have the most influence on future constitution.
3. Timeline visualisations.
4. Clustering and summarisation.
